## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Research recommends Next.js 16 + Supabase + Mux + Stripe stack (HIGH confidence)
- [Roadmap]: iOS PWA video playback freeze must be solved in Phase 3 (blob URL workaround)
- [Roadmap]: Mock data seeding deferred to Phase 8 (needs functional platform first)
- [Roadmap]: Live reactions use Supabase Realtime; start with accumulated-only in Phase 9

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Serwist (PWA service worker) requires Webpack but Next.js 16 defaults to Turbopack -- needs validation in Phase 1
- [Research]: Stripe Connect cross-border payout restrictions need research before Phase 5
- [Research]: Meta Conversions API requires domain verification -- start approval process early
