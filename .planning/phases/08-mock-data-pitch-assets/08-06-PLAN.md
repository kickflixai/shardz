<objective>
Build the creator landing page at /creators with waitlist signup, and create showcase dashboards (attribution tracking + social media ads) that are embedded in pitch pages.

Purpose: The creator landing page is the public-facing recruitment tool for attracting creators to the platform. The showcase dashboards demonstrate platform intelligence capabilities to investors and brand partners. Together these complete the remaining Phase 8 requirements (PTCH-08, SHOW-01, SHOW-02).

Output: Creator landing page with waitlist functionality, attribution dashboard component, and ad dashboard component integrated into pitch pages.

    **Check existing migration numbering first:** Run `ls supabase/migrations/` to find the correct next migration number. The research says 00000000000003 exists (price tiers). Use the next available number. If 00000000000006 is taken, adjust accordingly.

    **Create waitlist migration:**
    ```sql
    -- Waitlist for creator signups from landing page
    CREATE TABLE public.waitlist (
      id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
      email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
      source TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'creator_landing',
      created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
    );

    ALTER TABLE public.waitlist ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

    -- Anyone can join the waitlist (public signup form)
    CREATE POLICY "Anyone can join waitlist"
      ON public.waitlist FOR INSERT
      WITH CHECK (true);

    -- Only admins can read the waitlist
    CREATE POLICY "Admins can view waitlist"
      ON public.waitlist FOR SELECT
      USING (EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM public.profiles
        WHERE id = (SELECT auth.uid()) AND role = 'admin'
      ));
    ```

    **Update src/db/schema.sql** with the waitlist table definition (documentation copy).

    **IMPORTANT: Use the frontend-design plugin** for all components.

    **Create the creator landing page at /creators** (under existing (public) route group -- this page SHOULD show the site header/footer unlike pitch pages). Per locked decisions:
    - Separate page at /creators -- distinct from /dashboard/apply
    - Hero message: format validation angle -- "Short-form deserves its own home"
    - Transparent economics: "Creators keep 80% of every sale"
    - Waitlist signup: collect email
    - No social proof/testimonials -- product features only
    - No mock creator quotes
    - Links to /dashboard/apply for those ready to apply now

    **src/components/creators/creator-hero.tsx:**
    - Server component
    - Large headline: "Short-Form Deserves Its Own Home" (per locked decision)
    - Subheadline: "MicroShort is the first platform purpose-built for short-form series. Upload your content, set your price, and reach audiences who pay for what they love."
    - Primary CTA button: "Apply Now" -> /dashboard/apply
    - Secondary CTA: "Join the Waitlist" -> scrolls to waitlist section (#waitlist)
    - Full-viewport hero section with cinematic dark background and brand-yellow accents

    **src/components/creators/economics-section.tsx:**
    - Server component
    - Large visual showing the 80/20 revenue split:
      - Big "80%" with "Goes to you" label -- dominant visual
      - Small "20%" with "Platform fee" label
    - Visual split bar or pie diagram using CSS (not a chart library -- keep it simple and graphic)
    - Below the split: "You set the price. $0.99 to $7.99 per season."
    - Simple math example: "1,000 fans x $4.99 = $3,992 to you"
    - Comparison callout: "On social media, 1,000 views earns you ~$0.04. On MicroShort, 1,000 unlocks at $4.99 earns you $3,992."

    **src/components/creators/feature-grid.tsx:**
    - Server component
    - Responsive grid (3 cols desktop, 1 col mobile) of platform feature cards:
      1. "Upload Your Series" -- Film icon -- "Drag and drop your episodes. Set thumbnails, descriptions, and content warnings."
      2. "Set Your Price" -- DollarSign icon -- "Per-season pricing from $0.99 to $7.99. You control your business."
      3. "Track Everything" -- BarChart3 icon -- "Full-funnel analytics: views, conversions, revenue, and audience insights."
      4. "Build Community" -- Users icon -- "Discussion spaces, polls, and direct fan engagement per series."
      5. "Get Discovered" -- Search icon -- "Genre-based browsing puts your content in front of the right audience."
      6. "Get Paid" -- Wallet icon -- "Stripe Connect payouts. 80% creator share. Simple."
    - Each card: icon, title, description, subtle dark surface with hover effect
    - Creator types callout below the grid:
      - Row of badges/tags: "AI Filmmakers" | "Indie Studios" | "Comedy Creators" | "Musicians" | "Influencers" | "Documentarians"
      - Brief line: "Whether you're an AI filmmaker pushing boundaries or an indie studio with stories to tell -- MicroShort is your platform."

    **src/components/creators/waitlist-form.tsx:**
    - Client component ("use client")
    - Simple email input + submit button
    - Server action (inline "use server" function or separate action file) that:
      1. Validates email with Zod
      2. Inserts into waitlist table: `adminDb.from("waitlist").insert({ email, source: "creator_landing" })`
      3. Handles duplicate emails gracefully (UNIQUE constraint -- catch error, show "already on the list" message)
      4. Returns success/error state
    - Use the existing Supabase server client (not admin -- the RLS INSERT policy allows public inserts)
    - Success state: "You're on the list! We'll be in touch." with checkmark icon
    - Below form: "Ready now?" link -> /dashboard/apply
    - Section ID: `id="waitlist"` for anchor scrolling from hero CTA

    **Assemble the page at src/app/(public)/creators/page.tsx:**
    ```typescript
    import { CreatorHero } from "@/components/creators/creator-hero";
    import { EconomicsSection } from "@/components/creators/economics-section";
    import { FeatureGrid } from "@/components/creators/feature-grid";
    import { WaitlistForm } from "@/components/creators/waitlist-form";

    export const metadata = {
      title: "Create on MicroShort | Monetize Short-Form Series",
      description: "Upload short-form series, set your price, keep 80%. Join the platform built for creators.",
    };

    export default function CreatorsPage() {
      return (
        <>
          <CreatorHero />
          <EconomicsSection />
          <FeatureGrid />
          <WaitlistForm />
        </>
      );
    }
    ```

    Note: This page is under (public) route group, so it gets the site Header/Footer. This is intentional -- /creators is a public-facing page, not a pitch presentation.

    **Create showcase dashboard components** using the shadcn/ui chart component (Recharts wrapper) installed in 08-03. All data is MOCK -- realistic numbers designed to tell a compelling story about platform intelligence.

    **src/components/showcase/attribution-dashboard.tsx:**
    Client component ("use client") -- Recharts requires client rendering.

    **Attribution dashboard story (per discretion recommendation):**
    Combined funnel + ROI story showing platform intelligence:

    **Section 1: Source Attribution Funnel**
    - Stacked area chart showing viewer acquisition sources over 6 months:
      - Organic Search: growing steadily (80 -> 450)
      - Social Shares: accelerating growth (40 -> 350)
      - Paid Ads: steady investment (100 -> 250)
      - Direct: baseline (30 -> 120)
    - Mock monthly data (Jan-Jun) with realistic growth curves
    - Use ChartContainer, ChartTooltip, ChartTooltipContent from shadcn chart
    - Chart config using chart CSS variables: --chart-1 through --chart-4

    **Section 2: Creator ROI Metrics**
    - Bar chart showing per-genre performance:
      - Genres on X axis, revenue on Y axis
      - Sci-Fi highest (hero series effect), Comedy second, Thriller third
      - 6-8 genres shown with declining revenue bars
    - Key metric cards alongside:
      - "Avg. Revenue Per Series: $847"
      - "Avg. Conversion Rate: 12.3%"
      - "Avg. Subscriber Growth: +34%/mo"

    **Section 3: Content Performance (optional, include if space permits)**
    - Small heatmap or table showing best-performing time slots by genre
    - Simple enough to not overwhelm

    Wrap everything in a visually polished container with section headers, subtle borders, and the dark cinematic theme. Semi-interactive: responsive charts with tooltips and hover effects, but NO editable filters (per discretion recommendation).

    **src/components/showcase/ad-dashboard.tsx:**
    Client component ("use client").

    **Social media ad dashboard story (per discretion recommendation):**
    Unified cross-platform advertising view:

    **Section 1: Campaign Overview**
    - Summary metrics row:
      - Total Spend: $12,450
      - Total Impressions: 2.1M
      - Avg. CPM: $5.93
      - Avg. CTR: 3.2%
      - ROAS: 4.8x
    - Bar chart breaking down performance by platform:
      - Meta (Instagram/Facebook): highest spend, good ROAS
      - TikTok: lower spend, highest CTR
      - YouTube: moderate spend, moderate performance
      - X (Twitter): lowest spend, testing phase
    - Use ChartContainer with grouped bar chart (spend vs. revenue per platform)

    **Section 2: Content-as-Creative Performance**
    - Table or card layout showing "which series clips perform best as ad creative":
      - Series title, platform, impressions, CTR, conversions
      - Show 5-6 entries with realistic variation
      - Highlight SIGNAL LOST as top performer (hero series)

    **Section 3: Audience Insights**
    - Pie or donut chart: genre preference breakdown by platform
      - Meta audience prefers Drama, Comedy
      - TikTok audience prefers Action, Thriller
      - YouTube audience prefers Sci-Fi, Documentary
    - Simple demographic cards: "18-34: 68%", "Urban: 74%", "Mobile: 89%"

    All numbers are realistic for an early-stage content platform running test campaigns. Not inflated, not deflated -- credible.

    **Integrate dashboards into pitch pages:**

    **Update src/app/(pitch)/pitch/investors/page.tsx:**
    - Add a "Platform Intelligence" section between the features section and Why Now section
    - Embed `<AttributionDashboard />` with a header: "Track Every Viewer from First Touch to Revenue"
    - Brief description: "MicroShort gives creators and operators full visibility into how content performs and where audiences come from."
    - Import dynamically with `next/dynamic` and `ssr: false` (charts are client components)

    **Update src/app/(pitch)/pitch/brands/page.tsx:**
    - Add an "Ad Performance Dashboard" section between the Audience Insights section and Partnership Tiers section
    - Embed `<AdDashboard />` with a header: "Unified Campaign Intelligence Across Platforms"
    - Brief description: "See how your campaigns perform across Meta, TikTok, YouTube, and X -- all in one dashboard."
    - Import dynamically with `next/dynamic` and `ssr: false`

    - `grep "AdDashboard" src/app/'(pitch)'/pitch/brands/page.tsx` -- integrated into brand page
    - `grep "use client" src/components/showcase/attribution-dashboard.tsx` -- client component
    - `pnpm build 2>&1 | tail -20` -- build succeeds
  </verify>
  <done>
    Attribution dashboard shows source funnels (organic, social, paid, direct) with area chart and creator ROI metrics with bar chart. Ad dashboard shows unified campaign metrics across Meta/TikTok/YouTube/X with performance breakdowns and content-as-creative analysis. Both dashboards are embedded in their respective pitch pages (investor and brand). All charts use shadcn/ui chart (Recharts) with mock data and are semi-interactive (tooltips, hover effects, no editable filters).

<success_criteria>
The creator landing page would convince a prospective creator to join the waitlist or apply. The showcase dashboards demonstrate platform intelligence that would impress investors (attribution) and convince brands (ad performance). All Phase 8 requirements are covered: PTCH-08 (creator landing page), SHOW-01 (attribution dashboard), SHOW-02 (ad dashboard). SHOW-03 (content warnings) was explicitly dropped per user decision.
