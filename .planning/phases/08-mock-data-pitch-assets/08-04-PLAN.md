<objective>
Build the VC/investor pitch page and creator partner pitch page as standalone marketing pages using the shared pitch components.

Purpose: These are the two highest-priority pitch pages -- investors fund the vision, and creator partners supply the content. Each page must be compelling, vision-focused, and demonstrate the platform's capabilities through animated feature demos.

Output: Two production-quality pitch pages at /pitch/investors and /pitch/creators with audience-specific messaging, Remotion feature loops, and CTAs.

  <name>Task 1: Build VC/investor pitch page</name>
  <files>
    src/app/(pitch)/pitch/investors/page.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
    **IMPORTANT: Use the frontend-design plugin** for high design quality per locked decision. Must research compelling pitch page patterns/best practices before building per locked decision.

    Create the investor pitch page at `/pitch/investors`. This is the most critical pitch page -- it must convince VCs that MicroShort fills a real market gap.

    **Core narrative (per locked decision):** "Short-form video has no monetization layer -- MicroShort is the missing marketplace"

    **Tone (per discretion recommendation):** Bold, vision-driven, data-backed market opportunity. Lead with market gap, end with product capability.

    **Accent color:** Brand yellow (investor confidence/energy per discretion recommendation)

    **Page structure (top to bottom):**

    **1. Hero Section** (HeroSection variant="investor"):
    - Headline: "Short-Form Video Has No Monetization Layer"
    - Subheadline: "MicroShort is the marketplace that lets creators sell premium short-form series directly to audiences. No subscriptions. No ad-dependency. Just content worth paying for."
    - No fake traction numbers (locked decision)

    **2. Market Opportunity Section** (custom or StatsSection):
    - Present the market gap visually:
      - "4.5B+ short-form video viewers worldwide"
      - "$250B+ creator economy, yet creators earn <$0.01 per view from ads"
      - "0 platforms purpose-built for premium short-form series"
    - These are market-level data points (NOT fake MicroShort traction numbers)
    - Visual treatment: large stat cards with glass-morphism

    **3. How It Works Section:**
    - 3-step visual flow showing the business model:
      1. "Creators upload short-form series (1-3 min episodes)"
      2. "Viewers watch 3 episodes free, then pay to unlock full seasons"
      3. "Creators keep 80% of every sale"
    - Clean iconography, numbered steps, connecting visual flow

    **4. Platform Features Section** (FeatureSection variant="investor"):
    - 4 features with Remotion animated demos:
      1. "Cinematic Player" -- player-demo composition. "Vertical-first on mobile, theater mode on desktop. Built for the way people watch."
      2. "Genre Discovery" -- browse-demo composition. "Browse by genre. Every series is one tap away."
      3. "Instant Monetization" -- paywall-demo composition. "Free episodes hook viewers. One-tap unlock converts them to paying fans."
      4. "Creator Analytics" -- dashboard-demo composition. "Full-funnel visibility from first view to revenue."

    **5. Why Now Section:**
    - 3-4 bullet points on market timing:
      - AI filmmaking has collapsed production costs (anyone can create)
      - Short-form consumption is the dominant format (TikTok, Reels, Shorts trained the behavior)
      - Creators need direct monetization (ad revenue is declining and unreliable)
      - No incumbent owns this niche (YouTube, Netflix, TikTok don't offer per-series purchases)

    **6. CTA Section** (CTASection variant="investor"):
    - Primary CTA: "Explore the Platform" -> /browse
    - Secondary CTA: "Get in Touch" -> mailto:invest@microshort.com (or placeholder email)
    - Closing line: "The missing marketplace for short-form video."

    **Metadata:**
    ```typescript
    export const metadata: Metadata = {
      title: "MicroShort for Investors | The Missing Monetization Layer",
      description: "Short-form video has no monetization layer. MicroShort is the marketplace where creators sell premium series directly to audiences.",
    };
    ```

    The page composes shared components with investor-specific content. Keep copy concise and punchy -- every section should be scannable in under 10 seconds.

    - `ls src/app/'(pitch)'/pitch/investors/page.tsx` -- page exists
    - `grep -i "monetization\|marketplace\|investor" src/app/'(pitch)'/pitch/investors/page.tsx` -- investor-specific content

    - `grep "metadata" src/app/'(pitch)'/pitch/investors/page.tsx` -- has page metadata
    - No fake traction numbers: `grep -i "users\|downloads\|revenue.*\$[0-9]" src/app/'(pitch)'/pitch/investors/page.tsx` should show market stats only, not MicroShort-specific metrics
  </verify>
  <done>
    Investor pitch page at /pitch/investors renders with market gap narrative, market opportunity stats, how-it-works flow, 4 Remotion feature demos, why-now timing section, and CTAs. No fake traction numbers. Bold, vision-driven tone with brand-yellow accent.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Build creator partner pitch page</name>
  <files>
    src/app/(pitch)/pitch/creators/page.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
    **IMPORTANT: Use the frontend-design plugin** for high design quality.

    Create the creator partner pitch page at `/pitch/creators`. This page pitches approved creator partners on the monetization opportunity.

    **NOTE:** This is /pitch/creators (the pitch page for potential creator PARTNERS), NOT /creators (the public creator landing page built in 08-06). Different audience, different tone.

    **Tone (per discretion recommendation):** Empowering, transparent, community-building. Lead with format validation, end with economics. Direct, no corporate speak.

    **Accent color:** Brand yellow (this IS the platform pitch)

    **Page structure (top to bottom):**

    **1. Hero Section** (HeroSection variant="creator"):
    - Headline: "Your Short-Form Content Deserves to Earn"
    - Subheadline: "MicroShort gives you a platform purpose-built for short-form series. Upload, price, and sell directly to your audience. Keep 80% of every sale."

    **2. Economics Section:**
    - Large, transparent revenue split visualization:
      - "You keep 80%" (large, prominent)
      - "Platform takes 20%" (smaller, honest)
    - Visual comparison: "Average TikTok CPM: $0.02-0.04 per view" vs "MicroShort: $4.99 per season unlock"
    - "100 paying fans at $4.99 = $399 to you" (simple math, real numbers)
    - Per-season pricing flexibility: "$0.99 to $7.99 -- you set the price"

    **3. Platform Features Section** (FeatureSection variant="creator"):
    - 4 features with Remotion animated demos:
      1. "Self-Serve Upload" -- dashboard-demo composition. "Upload your series, set your price, and start earning. Full control over your catalog."
      2. "Genre Discovery" -- browse-demo composition. "Your series appears alongside the best short-form content. Genre-based browsing puts you in front of the right audience."
      3. "Free Episode Hooks" -- paywall-demo composition. "First 3 episodes free. Viewers get hooked, then pay to unlock. The funnel is built in."
      4. "Full-Funnel Analytics" -- dashboard-demo composition. "See exactly how viewers find you, watch, and convert. Data-driven growth."

    **4. Who This Is For Section:**
    - Cards or callouts for each creator type:
      - AI Filmmakers: "Push the boundaries of AI-generated storytelling"
      - Indie Studios: "Give your short films a dedicated home and revenue stream"
      - Comedy Creators: "Your sketches are worth more than ad impressions"
      - Music Artists: "Music series, visual albums, behind-the-scenes -- all monetized"
      - Influencers: "Turn your audience into paying subscribers for premium content"

    **5. How It Works Section:**
    - Simple 4-step flow:
      1. "Apply" -- Submit your portfolio for review
      2. "Upload" -- Add your series, seasons, and episodes
      3. "Price" -- Set per-season pricing ($0.99 - $7.99)
      4. "Earn" -- Payouts via Stripe Connect, 80% creator share

    **6. CTA Section** (CTASection variant="creator"):
    - Primary CTA: "Apply Now" -> /dashboard/apply
    - Secondary CTA: "Explore the Platform" -> /browse
    - Closing line: "The platform that pays creators what they're worth."

    **Metadata:**
    ```typescript
    export const metadata: Metadata = {
      title: "MicroShort for Creators | Monetize Your Short-Form Series",
      description: "Keep 80% of every sale. Upload short-form series, set your price, and earn directly from your audience on MicroShort.",
    };
    ```

    No social proof/testimonials -- let product features and economics speak (locked decision). No mock creator quotes (locked decision).

    Creator partner pitch page at /pitch/creators renders with transparent economics (80% creator share), platform feature demos, creator type callouts (AI filmmakers, indie studios, comedy, music, influencers), and CTAs linking to application form. No testimonials or mock quotes. Empowering, direct tone.
