<objective>
Build the brand/sponsor pitch page and advisor pitch page as standalone marketing pages using the shared pitch components.

Purpose: The brand page opens the door to advertising partnerships by presenting the full ad product vision. The advisor page recruits strategic advisors across entertainment, tech, and business domains. Together with the investor and creator pages (08-04), these complete the four-stakeholder pitch suite.

Output: Two production-quality pitch pages at /pitch/brands and /pitch/advisors with audience-specific messaging and CTAs.

  <name>Task 1: Build brand/sponsor pitch page</name>
  <files>
    src/app/(pitch)/pitch/brands/page.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
    **IMPORTANT: Use the frontend-design plugin** for high design quality.

    Create the brand/sponsor pitch page at `/pitch/brands`. Per locked decisions: present the full ad product vision (sponsored series, pre-roll ad spots, branded/native content partnerships) and position MicroShort as a brand-safe, genre-targeted advertising platform.

    **Tone (per discretion recommendation):** Professional, ROI-focused, brand-safety emphasis. Lead with genre-targeting precision, end with partnership options. Data-driven visuals.

    **Accent color:** Teal/cyan (corporate professionalism per discretion recommendation)

    **Page structure (top to bottom):**

    **1. Hero Section** (HeroSection variant="brand"):
    - Headline: "Reach Audiences by What They Love to Watch"
    - Subheadline: "MicroShort's genre-targeted marketplace puts your brand in front of engaged viewers who chose to pay for content they care about. Premium attention, not passive scrolling."

    **2. Why MicroShort for Brands Section:**
    - 3 key differentiators with icons:
      - "Genre-Targeted Precision": "Place your brand alongside specific genres -- reach sci-fi enthusiasts, comedy fans, or documentary viewers with surgical precision."
      - "Premium Attention": "Viewers on MicroShort are paying customers, not passive scrollers. Higher intent, higher engagement, higher recall."
      - "Brand-Safe Environment": "Curated creator marketplace with whitelisted creators. Your brand appears alongside quality content, every time."

    **3. Ad Products Section:**
    Present the full ad product vision:
    - **Sponsored Series**: "Fund original series with your brand woven into the narrative. Native storytelling, not interruptive ads."
      - Visual: mock sponsored series card with brand logo integration
    - **Pre-Roll Ad Spots**: "15-second pre-roll before free episodes. Reach viewers before they're hooked."
      - Visual: mock player with pre-roll countdown
    - **Branded Content Partnerships**: "Co-create content with top creators. Authentic brand storytelling for the short-form era."
      - Visual: mock co-branded series page

    These are presented as the VISION for the ad platform -- they don't need to be functional features yet.

    **4. Audience Insights Section:**
    - Present the audience profile opportunity:
      - Genre preference distribution (which genres have the most engaged viewers)
      - Demographic reach potential (short-form skews young but premium content broadens)
      - Engagement metrics advantage (paying users vs. free social media viewers)
    - Use simple visual representations (cards with icons, not full charts -- charts are in 08-06 showcase)

    **5. Partnership Tiers Section:**
    - 3 partnership levels:
      - "Launch Partner": First-mover advantage, category exclusivity, co-marketing support
      - "Genre Sponsor": Own a genre category, branded genre page, featured placement
      - "Series Sponsor": Fund specific series, native integration, creator collaboration
    - Presented as cards with increasing visual prominence

    **6. CTA Section** (CTASection variant="brand"):
    - Primary CTA: "Explore the Platform" -> /browse
    - Secondary CTA: "Partner With Us" -> mailto:brands@microshort.com (or placeholder)
    - Closing line: "Where brands meet audiences who are ready to engage."

    **Metadata:**
    ```typescript
    export const metadata: Metadata = {
      title: "MicroShort for Brands | Genre-Targeted Short-Form Advertising",
      description: "Reach paying, engaged audiences through genre-targeted advertising on MicroShort. Sponsored series, pre-roll spots, and branded content partnerships.",
    };
    ```
  </action>

    - `ls src/app/'(pitch)'/pitch/brands/page.tsx` -- page exists
    - `grep -i "brand-safe\|genre-target\|sponsored\|pre-roll" src/app/'(pitch)'/pitch/brands/page.tsx` -- ad product vision content
    - `grep "HeroSection\|CTASection" src/app/'(pitch)'/pitch/brands/page.tsx` -- uses shared components
    - `grep "variant.*brand" src/app/'(pitch)'/pitch/brands/page.tsx` -- uses brand variant
    - `grep "metadata" src/app/'(pitch)'/pitch/brands/page.tsx` -- has page metadata
  </verify>
  <done>
    Brand pitch page at /pitch/brands presents the full ad product vision: sponsored series, pre-roll ad spots, branded content partnerships. Positions MicroShort as brand-safe and genre-targeted. Professional tone with teal accent. Partnership tiers show escalating engagement options.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Build advisor pitch page</name>
  <files>
    src/app/(pitch)/pitch/advisors/page.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
    **IMPORTANT: Use the frontend-design plugin** for high design quality.

    Create the advisor pitch page at `/pitch/advisors`. Per locked decision: cast wide -- entertainment, tech, and business advisory expertise, not limited to one domain.

    **Tone (per discretion recommendation):** Storytelling, strategic framing, visionary. Lead with industry transformation narrative, end with how advisors shape the platform. Less hard sell, more invitation.

    **Accent color:** Amber/gold (wisdom/prestige per discretion recommendation)

    **Page structure (top to bottom):**

    **1. Hero Section** (HeroSection variant="advisor"):
    - Headline: "Help Shape the Future of Short-Form Entertainment"
    - Subheadline: "MicroShort is building the marketplace that turns short-form video into a viable creative business. We're looking for advisors who see the transformation coming."

    **2. The Opportunity Section:**
    - Strategic narrative (storytelling tone, not bullet points):
      - The convergence: AI-powered creation + short-form consumption habits + no premium monetization layer = massive market gap
      - The timing: Short-form is the dominant format, but creators can't monetize it beyond ads. The window for a dedicated marketplace is NOW.
      - The vision: MicroShort becomes the definitive platform where short-form series are discovered, purchased, and celebrated.
    - Presented as a flowing narrative with large pull-quotes or highlighted key phrases

    **3. Where Advisors Make Impact Section:**
    Three advisory domain cards (per locked decision -- cast wide across domains):

    - **Entertainment & Content Strategy**: "Guide content curation, creator relations, genre strategy, and the viewer experience. Help us build the taste-making layer."
      - Ideal profile: Entertainment executives, content curators, talent managers, film festival programmers
    - **Technology & Product**: "Shape the platform's technical roadmap -- from AI-powered discovery to creator tools to the viewing experience."
      - Ideal profile: Product leaders from streaming/social platforms, AI/ML experts, video technology specialists
    - **Business & Growth**: "Advise on go-to-market, creator acquisition, brand partnerships, and monetization strategy."
      - Ideal profile: Startup operators, marketplace strategists, media business executives, growth leaders

    **4. What We Offer Section:**
    - Advisory board benefits:
      - Direct input on product direction and strategic decisions
      - Equity participation (advisory shares)
      - Early access to platform data and market insights
      - Network of fellow advisors across entertainment, tech, and business
    - Presented with subtle premium styling (gold accents, refined typography)

    **5. The Platform Today Section:**
    Brief overview of what's already built:
    - "Functional marketplace with genre discovery, video player, payments, and creator dashboard"
    - "Ready for first wave of content and creators"
    - Link to explore: "See it for yourself" -> /browse
    - This section grounds the pitch in reality -- it's not just a slide deck, it's a working product

    **6. CTA Section** (CTASection variant="advisor"):
    - Primary CTA: "Explore the Platform" -> /browse
    - Secondary CTA: "Join Our Advisory Board" -> mailto:advisors@microshort.com (or placeholder)
    - Closing line: "The best platforms are shaped by the people who see what's next."

    **Metadata:**
    ```typescript
    export const metadata: Metadata = {
      title: "MicroShort Advisory Board | Shape the Future of Short-Form Entertainment",
      description: "Join MicroShort's advisory board. We're seeking entertainment, technology, and business leaders to help build the definitive short-form video marketplace.",
    };
    ```

  </verify>
  <done>
    Advisor pitch page at /pitch/advisors presents strategic vision across entertainment, tech, and business advisory domains. Storytelling tone with amber/gold accent. Shows where advisors make impact, what's offered, and what's already built. Invitational rather than hard-sell.

- /pitch/brands loads with ad product vision, brand-safety positioning, and partnership tiers
- /pitch/advisors loads with strategic narrative, three advisory domains, and advisory benefits

</verification>

<success_criteria>
Both pitch pages are production-quality marketing pages. The brand page would convince a marketing director that MicroShort is a viable advertising platform. The advisor page would convince a senior executive that joining the advisory board is a prestigious and impactful opportunity. Together with 08-04, all four stakeholder pitch pages are complete.
